Even if you donâ€™t code, or even know much about IT, the goal of anydub is to provide clear and easy steps to follow to quickly and easily create your own beautiful, fast, modern website, live and hosted for free, provide you a platform to reach your audience, and make it all easy and interesting. 

anybdub is built with gatsby, netlify cms, react javascript, node, graphql, netlify jamstack cms, jamstack, and git. Look ma, no database!

Currently, anydub is significantly copied from gatsby-starter-lumen. gatsby-starter-lumen is a great boilerplate for some of the features outline below, but anydub is influenced by several other projects and is under development to incorporate the bests of the gatsy starter projects available on github. The goal for anydub is to grow as a CMS to be 100% configurable and extendable, with features on par with wordpress featurewise, but with much faster rendering, much better scalability, cheaper to free to host, and easier, doper, and more lucrative to code.
